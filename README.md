Experimentation: <br>
- Ensemble methods (runs out of memory at majority vote stage)
- DBSCAN experiment (poor performance)
- FAMD experiment (failed to implement correctly)
- GMM (performs well but discarded as KMeans performs better and this was just testing for better performance due to oblong clusters)
